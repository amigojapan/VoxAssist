â€”up to here most things have been implemented

To do:

0). need to add a feture to editor to move chuncks of code aroudn in a file, like move lines form line 20 to line 30 to line 15

1). Blind Menu (a kind of desktop for those who prefer to use a menu rather than commands, works kind of like a menu on the telephone)

2). BlindWEB (A web client that accesses a group of webpages designed  specifically for the blind), this will also allow people to host their own applications made for BlindOS on the web 

3). Blind Mail Client

4). Blind Music Player

5). Blind App Downloader(package manager)

Other applications for the blind are welcome and will be added to BlindOS

known bugs:

FIXED-virc quits qith Excess Flood after flooding PONG for some reason

running as ./runBlindOE.py sometimes ends up with an eternal loop of just entering and quitting from BlindOE
